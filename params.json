Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/foggy. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n",
